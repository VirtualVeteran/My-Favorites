<ul>
    <li>FLORIDA</li>
    <h2>I lived in Florida the longest, but in each town roughly about 4 years. We moved more than the list below, probably about 10 or more times while I was growing up. The denomination that my father was a part of believed in rotating their Reverands to prevent stagnation in congregations.</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Sebring</li>
        <p>This is the first church I remember, but there were others before. This was the first offical location my father had by himself. The congregation was very old, and they passed away frequently. I probably saw 15 open casket funerals from age 6-10, which I found very interesting at the time.</p>
        <li>Cocoa</li>
        <p>This was a much better time in my life, the church had a kid my age, and the kid had a ranch that I worked on from age 11-16. I got into 4 H and raised chickens/goats. </p>
        <li>Port Charlotte</li>
        <p>We moved here without a job, because my dad was worried about his mom's health. It was a very rough time financially, (because my father and mother had seven kids),but we did get to go to the beach more often.</p>

    </ul>
</li>
</ul>
   
</ul>
<li>GEORGIA</li>
<h2>I moved to Georgia when my father left the ministry, and graduation in Warner Robins. After joining the USAF, I was stationed in Valdosta for 5 years.</h2>

     <li>Warner Robins</li>
     <p>My dad was offically out of work and ministry, but found a job with a family friend in GA. We moved during my senior year, and I graduated with strangers. The silver lining was meeting my bestfriend and current spouse of almost 10 years. I got married at 19 in this town.</p>
     <li>Valdosta</li>
     <p>I moved here the day I married my spouse and worked odd jobs for 2 years while working on my Associates. I joined the USAF, and got stationed in Valdosta with my spouse who was already Active Duty USAF at that location.</p>
